# Unhandled error in React Native caused by accessing state before component mount

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where state or props are accessed before the component has fully mounted.  The error arises from attempting to access `this.props` within the `constructor` or before the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

## Problem

Accessing `this.props` within the constructor is problematic because the component's properties might not yet be fully populated. This leads to `undefined` values or errors.  The solution involves using the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method to access and process props or make API calls that update the state.

## Solution

The solution involves moving the access of props to the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method. The state is updated after the component has successfully mounted, ensuring that props are available and valid.
